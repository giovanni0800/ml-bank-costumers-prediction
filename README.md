<h1 align="center">Credit availability analysis with ML</h1>

## 📖️ About
<p>
Within the ML classes, I began to deepen my knowledge in a practical way to train an AI to predict the possible score of customers to automate and provide greater speed, as well as efficiency in the analysis of possible customers eligible to receive credit.

Through the supervised training process, it was possible to follow the methodology and libraries to be used to prepare the analysis of an AI, the logic behind the entire process, and which tools best stand out in which activities.

It was an enriching project in terms of understanding analyzes using ML for greater efficiency, effectiveness and surprising speed!
